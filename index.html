					<h1> Forest Service Interactive Map </h1>
					<p> Did you know that, just like the population census, the US conducts a yearly census on forests?
						The Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program collects data on "how much forest exists, where it exists,
						who owns it, how it is changing, how the trees and other forest vegetation are growing, how much has died
						or been removed, and how the harvested trees have been used in recent years." (USDA, 2016)<br> Select an attribute
					from the dropdown menu to see how several US states measure up. <br> The attributes represented are:
			acres of forested area; acres of land used for timber; number (in hundreds) of live trees; number (in hundreds) of dead trees; and
			metric tons of carbon stored in live trees.  All data have been normalized by area.   </p>
